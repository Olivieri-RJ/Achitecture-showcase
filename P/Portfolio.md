## 🧠 About

I’m a multidisciplinary technical developer focused on **embedded systems**, **sensor integration**, and **adaptive smart solutions**.  
My work translates logic into **scalable, real-world automation** — from motor control and BLE communication to responsive environments and assistive systems.

I develop systems that **adapt**, **respond**, and **operate safely**, even in unpredictable scenarios.  
**Performance**, **reliability**, and **usability** drive everything I build.

Whether prototyping low-cost IoT devices, optimizing safety logic, or integrating sensors with TinyML, I deliver firmware that works:  
**clearly documented**, **lean**, and **ready for the field**.
